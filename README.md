# Namada Block Explorer Issues (Central Repo)

This repository collects usability and functionality reports for various block explorers in the [Namada](https://namada.net/start#explorers) ecosystem.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to gather community feedback on the accuracy, usability, and reliability of different block explorers, since not all explorers have their own public repo. This helps explorer maintainers identify issues, improve user experience, and ensure correct on-chain data representation.

## ✅ What to Report

Please submit an issue if you encounter any of the following:

- Incorrect or outdated information
- Missing data you expected to see
- Features not working as expected
- Confusing or hard-to-use UI/UX
- General usability concerns or improvement ideas

## 📋 How to Report

Click “New Issue” and select the **Block Explorer Audit Report** form. If the same issue exists on multiple explorers, **please submit a single report** and list all affected URLs.

Try to include:
- A clear description of what you were doing
- What went wrong or what was confusing
- Screenshots or screen recordings (if possible)
- Device/browser info to help reproduce the issue

## 🌍 Explorers List

You can find a list of explorers on:
- https://namada.net/start#explorers (Mainnet explorers)
- https://namada.community/infra/explorers (both Mainnet and Testnet explorers)
